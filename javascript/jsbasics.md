# JavaScript Basics

## Connect a JavaScript file

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="./index.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  ...
</body>
```

The `script` tag has two attributes:

`src="./index.js"` sets the URL to our JavaScript file

`defer` tells the browser to delay the loading of the script until all HTML elements are loaded.

> ðŸ’¡ Alternative: `script` tag at the end of the body element, so `defer` attribute is not
> necessary. Less modern.

```html
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Selecting HTML Elements: `.querySelector()`

Before we can add interactivity, we need to select the necessary HTML-Elements:

## Add Interaction: `.addEventListener()`

We can listen to **events** like **clicks** on an Element and execute code when the event is
triggered. The method `addEventListener` is used to react to events.

## Add/remove & toggle classes: `.classList.`

You can add, remove and toggle classes, e.g. to change the styling of an element.
